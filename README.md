# Happy Places

Hi Everyone: let me know if you want any branch names changed (ie. technical names changed to personal names) or any adjustment/additions.

Per the rubruic for the first deliverable, make sure you each have at least four commits.

Also this from the rubric:
**"Note: The descriptions and explanations required in all other project deliverables should also be in your README.md as part of your outline, unless otherwise noted."** 

Finally, there's this:
"**README.md must include: âœ“ Description of the communicationprotocols"**

## Communication Protocols


Slack for group messaging
Coda for planning
Discord for conversations
